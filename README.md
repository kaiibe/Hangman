<h1>Hangman Game</h1>

<p>This is a simple Hangman game created with Python. The game generates a random word from a list of words and the user has to guess the word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The game displays a hanging man and the progress of the user's guesses as they try to figure out the word.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>To run the game, you need to have Python installed on your system. Once Python is installed, you can download the code files from the repository and launch the game from your terminal or IDE by running main.py</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>

<p>When you run the Hangman game, a random word will be selected from a pre-defined list of words. The game will then display a series of underscores representing each letter in the word, like this: '_ _ _ _ _ _'.</p>
<p>The player's goal is to guess the word by inputting one letter at a time. If the letter is correct, the game will replace the corresponding underscore with the correct letter. For example, if the word was "banana" and the player correctly guessed the letter "a", the game would display: '_ a _ a _ a'.</p>
<p>If the player guesses an incorrect letter, the game will display a part of a hangman drawing. The hangman drawing will gradually become more complete with each incorrect guess. If the player guesses incorrectly too many times, the hangman will be fully displayed and the game will end.</p>
<p>The player can keep guessing letters until they either successfully guess the word, or the hangman drawing is fully displayed. If the player successfully guesses the word before the hangman drawing is fully displayed, they win the game. If the hangman drawing is fully displayed before the player successfully guesses the word, they lose the game.</p>
<p>That's it! Have fun playing Hangman!.</p>
