<h1>Hangman Game</h1>

<p>This is a simple Hangman game created with Python. The game generates a random word from a list of words and the user has to guess the word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The game displays a hanging man and the progress of the user's guesses as they try to figure out the word.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>To run the game, you need to have Python installed on your system. Once Python is installed, you can download the code files from the repository and launch the game from your terminal or IDE by running main.py</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>

<p>When you run the game, a random word will be selected from the list of words, and the number of blank spaces for the letters in the word will be displayed. The user can input a letter and the game will check if the letter is correct. If the letter is correct, the game will display the letter in the blank spaces. If the letter is incorrect, the game will display a part of a hanging man. The user can keep guessing letters until they guess the word or the hanging man is fully displayed.</p>
